This website is a static site built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML structures the content, CSS handles the styling and layout, and JavaScript is used to 
add basic interactive elements or functionality, such as simple animations or user interactions. The site presents fixed content, including product details, pricing, and contact 
information, and while it features some interactive JavaScript components, it remains a static site without dynamic content updates or server-side interactions.
